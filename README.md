# Self-Superivsed Multi-Object Tracking
In this project, we introduce a semi-supervised learning framework for both ReID and motion estimation, which not only alleviates the challenge of obtaining expensive tracking annotations, but also solves inherent biases in modern methods towards motion linearity and distinct object appearance. We first generate pseudo tracks using ByteTrack and use these generated tracks as ground truth to train novel ReID and motion models. In principal, the work is similar to Simple Unsupervised MOT, but that work only uses pseudo-ground truth for training a ReID model. In this project, we also use pseudo-ground truth to train motion estimation models. As a basic framework for motion estimation models, we derived inspiration from Transormer based MOT which uses transformers to learn motion models using just bounding box sequences.
